## Toolbox Installation and Data Downloading
### Download and setup meta files.

Suppose that toolkit is install on $PATH_PTool:
  ```Shell
  cd $PATH_PTool
  bash download_meta.sh
  ```
  
### Download images.

You can easily download images in parallel (12 workers by default) and resize the downloaded images to 224x224:
  ```Shell
  cd $PATH_PTool
  python download_images.py
  ```
There are ~5 million images in the dataset. The download process can take days.

The script allows you to resume your downloading at any time.
Just re-run download_images.py if your downloading is shutted down unexpectedly.
It is possible that you failed to access some of the urls at the first time.
Re-run download_images.py to have another try.

You are welcome to read [download_images.py](download_images.py) and [py_utils.py](py_utils.py) for personalized and advanced downloading settings (e.g. see the docstring of [py_utils.PinDataset.download_images](py_utils.py#L100-L150)).
